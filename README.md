# Tabgrid~
<p>Tabgrid~ and its parent patch SFXGrid~ are PureData abstractions designed to play sound files in a simple and efficient manner. This is intended for a wide user base who might not have any prior experience with PureData to be able to use right out of the box.</p>

## Contents
<p>Enclosed with this repository are five .zip file "kits" for players to begin experimenting with using sound effects. Note that there are some repeated files in each kit, as they are designed to be usable directly out of the box with no additional downloads (beyond PureData, of course).</p>
